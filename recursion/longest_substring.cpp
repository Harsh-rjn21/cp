/*
Longest Substring with At Least K Repeating Characters
Given a string s and an integer k, return the length of the longest substring of s such that the frequency of each character in this substring is greater than or equal to k.

Example 1:
Input: s = "aaabb", k = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: The longest substring is "aaa", as 'a' is repeated 3 times.

Example 2:
Input: s = "ababbc", k = 2
Output: 5
Explanation: The longest substring is "ababb", as 'a' is repeated 2 times and 'b' is repeated 3 times.
 

Constraints:
1 <= s.length <= 104
s consists of only lowercase English letters.
1 <= k <= 105
